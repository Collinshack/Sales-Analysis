# Sales-Analysis
This is an analysis of the annual sales of a company that deals in electronics. The goal of this project is to answer business questions that will help the company make informed decisions and increase growth and profits.

The dataset used in this project includes sales data from the year 2019, including sales volume, revenue, and other related metrics. The analysis was done using Python and its data analysis libraries: Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib.

The questions answered in this analysis include:
- What is the best month for sales? How much was earned?
- What city made the highest purchase?
- What time should we display advertisements to maximize likelihood of customer's buying product?
- What products are most often sold together?
- What product sold the most? Why do you think so?

The project provides visualizations of the data in the form of bar charts to help with understanding and interpretation of the results.

The insights and recommendations from this analysis can help the company make data-driven decisions, optimize inventory management, and increase revenue.
